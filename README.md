# hello-world

This is my first repository. Humble beginnings I suppose.

I'm here to gain some sort of a deeper understanding of technology at large. I want to be proficcient with *some* code and visual editors. Systemology fascinates me and I think it could be useful.

I'm open to falling in love with some parts of this. But I will use this to supplement my current passions. And that alone.

Don't waste time. Be a Sponge...
